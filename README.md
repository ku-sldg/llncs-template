# Using This Template
1. Replace this readme with a description of the paper
2. Run `make` and follow the prompt to rename the paper
3. Edit the author section including emails, thanks, running header,
   and add orcid fields.	
4. Update the `bib` submodule as needed by running `git submodule update --remote`.
5. Some includes are commented out as they are not always needed.
   Uncomment what you need and add others as needed. 
6. If you do not want to use `natbib` remove `\usepackage{natbib}`,
   add `\usepackage{cite}`, and swap `bibliographystyle` commands at
   the end of the document.
